Pokémon Logo

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
This is a recreation of the classic English logo for the Pokémon games, based on the logo for Pokémon X and Y.
The white fill mesh can be hidden to uncover the full depth of the gaps between the letters.
